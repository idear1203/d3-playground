D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. More information. See [D3's official website](https://d3js.org) for more information.

After a few days of trying D3.js, I am deeply impressed by many cool examples based on D3.js. So I determined to study this visualization library systematically.

I hope I could insist on learning it. And maybe I will become an expert on D3.js somedayüòè

Fighting on front end, Aaron!
